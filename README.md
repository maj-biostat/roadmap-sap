# roadmap-sap

Statistical analysis plan, simulation report and notes for roadmap trial.

## Update procedures

Are documented in the SAP, but to repeat:

1. Prior to each analysis, ensure that the SAP is aligned with the present design and that there is a release that corresponds to the latest version.
2. If there is no github release, then create one and give it a sensible release identifier.
3. If a release already exists that is aligned with the present design, then that is the one that should be referenced for the analysis.

Note that for this repository, all changes can likely be made on main and push directly.

See https://github.com/maj-biostat/roadmap-sap/releases for the full set of releases.
